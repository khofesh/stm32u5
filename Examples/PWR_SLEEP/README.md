## <b>PWR_SLEEP Example Description</b>

-   How to enter the Sleep mode and wake up from this mode by using an interrupt.  

-   In the associated software, the system clock is set to 160 MHz.
an EXTI line is connected to the user button through PC.13 and configured
to generate an interrupt on falling edge upon key press.
The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick
interrupt handler, LED7 is toggled in order to indicate whether the MCU is in SLEEP mode
or RUN mode.  

-   5 seconds after start-up, the system automatically enters SLEEP mode and
LED7 stops toggling.  
-   The USER push-button can be pressed at any time to wake-up the system.  
-   The software then comes back in RUN mode for 5 sec. before automatically entering SLEEP mode again.  
-   LED7 is used to monitor the system state as follows :  
    -   **LED7 toggling**: system in RUN mode  
    -   **LED7 OFF** : system in SLEEP mode  

-   These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.  

#### <b>Notes</b>
 1. This example is not meant to reflect typical product power consumption values but shows how to use the software to switch from power modes.
For power consumption measurement, please check the PWR_ModesSelection example under  available Projects\NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q\Examples\PWR\PWR_ModesSelection folder.

 2. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact
      that the Cortex-M33 core is no longer clocked during low power mode
      so debugging features are disabled.

 3. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 4. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
